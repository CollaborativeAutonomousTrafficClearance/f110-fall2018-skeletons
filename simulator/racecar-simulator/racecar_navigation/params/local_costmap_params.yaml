#The "global_frame", "robot_base_frame", "update_frequency", and "static_map" parameters are the same as described in the 
#Global Configuration file


local_costmap:
  global_frame: map
  robot_base_frame: base_link
  update_frequency: 4.0
  publish_frequency: 4.0
  #The "publish_frequency" parameter determines the rate, in Hz, at which the costmap will publish visualization information. 

  static_map: false
  rolling_window: true
  #Setting the "rolling_window" parameter to true means that the costmap will remain centered around the robot as the robot moves through the world. 


  width: 4.0
  height: 4.0
  resolution: 0.1
  #The "width," "height," and "resolution" parameters set the width (meters), height (meters), and resolution (meters/cell) of the costmap. 
  #Note that its fine for the resolution of this grid to be different than the resolution of your static map, 
  #but most of the time we tend to set them equally.
